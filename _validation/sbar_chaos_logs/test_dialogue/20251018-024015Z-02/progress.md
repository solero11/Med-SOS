_t=0.0s, run=20251018-024015Z-02_

_Note: LLM returned unstructured text; populated SBAR using deterministic fallback._

### Situation
Patient is hypotensive after induction, blood pressure seventy over forty.

### Background
Limited chart data available; patient under general anesthesia with new hypotension.

### Assessment
Differential: 1) Tension pneumothorax 2) Hypovolemia 3) Equipment failure

### Recommendation
Initiate emergency decompression protocol and alert supervising anesthesia.

### Differential
Tension pneumothorax; Hypovolemia; Equipment failure

### Clinical Supervisor Critique
Acknowledged. Begin airway, breathing, circulation assessment and notify the clinician of any rapid deterioration. (Echo: Evaluate the following SBAR summary and provide a brief critique (max 3 bullets):

## ðŸ©º Final Scene Summary

**Overall Summary:** Scene test_dialogue captured 3 SBAR updates. Initial situation: Patient is hypotensive after induction, blood pressure seventy over forty.

**Diagnostic Impression:**
- Tension pneumothorax
- Hypovolemia
- Equipment failure

**Lessons:**
- Validate differential diagnoses continuously against new SBAR data.
- Escalate invasive interventions promptly once non-invasive measures plateau.

**Final Recommendation:** Initiate emergency decompression protocol and alert supervising anesthesia.
