## Situation
[ventilator cycling] okay tidal volume six-fifty pressure thirty two looks fine

## Background
Limited chart data available; patient under general anesthesia with new hypotension.

## Assessment
Differential: 1) Tension pneumothorax 2) Hypovolemia 3) Equipment failure

## Recommendation
Initiate emergency decompression protocol and alert supervising anesthesia.

**Differential:** Tension pneumothorax; Hypovolemia; Equipment failure

## Clinical Supervisor Critique
Acknowledged. Begin airway, breathing, circulation assessment and notify the clinician of any rapid deterioration. (Echo: Evaluate the following SBAR summary and provide a brief critique (max 3 bullets):

## ðŸ©º Final Scene Summary

**Overall Summary:** Scene dialogue captured 57 SBAR updates. Initial situation: [ventilator cycling] okay tidal volume six-fifty pressure thirty two looks fine

**Diagnostic Impression:**
- Tension pneumothorax
- Hypovolemia
- Equipment failure

**Lessons:**
- Validate differential diagnoses continuously against new SBAR data.
- Escalate invasive interventions promptly once non-invasive measures plateau.

**Final Recommendation:** Initiate emergency decompression protocol and alert supervising anesthesia.
