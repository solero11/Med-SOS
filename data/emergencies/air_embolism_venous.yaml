summary: >
  Entry of air into the venous circulation causing obstruction of pulmonary
  blood flow, hypoxemia, and cardiovascular collapse if untreated.

signals:
  - "Sudden drop in ETCO2 with hypotension or hypoxemia"
  - "Precordial Doppler or TEE detection of air bubbles"
  - "Mill-wheel murmur or aspiration of air via central line"

red_flags:
  - "Right heart strain or paradoxical embolism in patients with shunts"
  - "Cardiovascular collapse despite supportive measures"

primary_differential:
  - "Pulmonary embolism"
  - "Tension pneumothorax"
  - "Massive hemorrhage"
  - "Anaphylaxis"

first_checks:
  - "Alert surgical team and flood field with saline"
  - "Place patient in Durant or left lateral decubitus with head down"
  - "Aspirate air via central venous catheter if present"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Can venous access be positioned to aspirate entrained air effectively?"
  - "Would transesophageal echo clarify ongoing air entrainment?"
  - "Is patient at risk for paradoxical embolism requiring bubble filters?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid nitrous oxide which can expand intravascular air"
  - "Limit PEEP that might worsen venous air entry"
