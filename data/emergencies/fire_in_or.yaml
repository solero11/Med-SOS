summary: >
  Ignition involving oxidizers, fuels, and ignition sources in the operating
  room that requires rapid suppression, patient protection, and oxygen control.

signals:
  - "Visual flames or smoke near surgical field or airway"
  - "Burning smell or alarms from equipment"
  - "End-tidal oxygen reading elevated despite target levels"

red_flags:
  - "Airway fire with ongoing oxygen flow"
  - "Patient burns requiring immediate cooling and assessment"

primary_differential:
  - "Airway fire"
  - "Surgical field fire"
  - "Equipment ignition"

first_checks:
  - "Stop the procedure and announce fire"
  - "Disconnect oxygen/oxidizer sources if safe"
  - "Extinguish flames with saline or CO2 extinguisher per location"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Has the oxygen concentration been minimized to reduce recurrence?"
  - "Do we need to inspect airway or tissues for hidden damage?"
  - "Could equipment malfunction require biomedical evaluation before reuse?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid reopening oxygen quickly without confirming fire is out"
  - "Do not use water on electrical fires; follow facility protocol"
