summary: >
  Excessive cephalad spread of neuraxial local anesthetic causing profound
  sympathetic block, bradycardia, and respiratory compromise.

signals:
  - "Rapid hypotension and bradycardia after neuraxial dosing"
  - "Difficulty breathing, voice change, or upper extremity weakness"
  - "Diminished motor and sensory function above expected block level"

red_flags:
  - "Apnea requiring immediate airway support"
  - "Cardiac arrest despite resuscitation efforts"

primary_differential:
  - "High spinal block"
  - "Intrathecal catheter migration"
  - "Local anesthetic systemic toxicity"
  - "Vasovagal reaction"

first_checks:
  - "Support airway and ventilation with 100% oxygen"
  - "Treat hypotension with vasopressors and IV fluids"
  - "Consider intralipid therapy if LAST suspected concurrently"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Was dosing appropriate for patient size and catheter depth?"
  - "Could intrathecal catheter migration have gone unnoticed?"
  - "Is conversion to general anesthesia indicated for ongoing surgery?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid large bolus doses when incremental titration is possible"
  - "Prepare for rapid sequence induction if airway reflexes lost"
