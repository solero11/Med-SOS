summary: >
  Rapid blood loss exceeding 150 ml per minute or anticipated replacement of
  an entire blood volume requiring coordinated resuscitation and hemostasis.

signals:
  - "High suction canister volumes or saturating sponges quickly"
  - "Hemodynamic instability with dropping hematocrit"
  - "Need for rapid transfusion of multiple units"

red_flags:
  - "Coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, or hypothermia developing during resuscitation"
  - "Failure to respond to transfusion and surgical control efforts"

primary_differential:
  - "Surgical bleeding site"
  - "Coagulopathy"
  - "Dilutional thrombocytopenia"
  - "Occult bleeding (retroperitoneal, thoracic)"

first_checks:
  - "Activate massive transfusion protocol and notify blood bank"
  - "Ensure large-bore IV or rapid infuser access"
  - "Warm fluids and monitor temperature, calcium, acid-base status"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Have laboratory parameters guided the component therapy ratios?"
  - "Is surgical or interventional control progressing adequately?"
  - "Could adjuncts like TXA or cell salvage support hemostasis?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid uncrossmatched blood if time allows for type-specific products"
  - "Monitor for transfusion reactions and electrolyte shifts closely"
