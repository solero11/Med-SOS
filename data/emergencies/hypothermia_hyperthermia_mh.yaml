summary: >
  Dangerous deviations in body temperature, including malignant hyperthermia,
  that affect metabolic rate, coagulation, and organ function and demand specific therapies.

signals:
  - "Rapid rise in end-tidal CO2 and muscle rigidity"
  - "Core temperature below 35°C or above 39°C"
  - "Metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or arrhythmias"

red_flags:
  - "Persistent hypercarbia despite increased minute ventilation"
  - "Myoglobinuria or renal injury markers"

primary_differential:
  - "Malignant hyperthermia"
  - "Sepsis"
  - "Thyrotoxic crisis"
  - "Overheating from warming devices"
  - "Hypothermia from exposure or massive transfusion"

first_checks:
  - "Stop triggering agents and call MH hotline if suspected"
  - "Administer dantrolene per protocol for malignant hyperthermia"
  - "Initiate active warming or cooling strategies as appropriate"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Have labs been drawn to monitor electrolytes and CK levels?"
  - "Could other causes like sepsis or thyroid storm better explain the picture?"
  - "Is ICU transfer required for ongoing temperature management?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid calcium channel blockers during dantrolene therapy"
  - "Prevent rapid temperature shifts that destabilize hemodynamics"
