summary: >
  Catastrophic obstetric event characterized by sudden cardiovascular collapse,
  hypoxemia, and coagulopathy following amniotic fluid entry into maternal circulation.

signals:
  - "Acute hypoxia and hypotension during labor, delivery, or soon after"
  - "Seizure-like activity or altered mental status"
  - "Rapid development of DIC and uterine atony"

red_flags:
  - "Refractory coagulopathy requiring massive transfusion"
  - "Pulmonary hypertension leading to right heart failure"

primary_differential:
  - "Amniotic fluid embolism"
  - "Pulmonary embolism"
  - "Anaphylaxis"
  - "Septic shock"

first_checks:
  - "Call obstetric, anesthesia, and critical care teams immediately"
  - "Support oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation aggressively"
  - "Activate massive transfusion protocol and manage coagulopathy"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Is ECMO or advanced cardiac support available if shock persists?"
  - "Could another diagnosis like pulmonary embolism better explain findings?"
  - "Has fetal status been accounted for while stabilizing the mother?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid delays in transfusion support while awaiting laboratory confirmation"
  - "Balance uterotonic therapy with cardiovascular stability"
