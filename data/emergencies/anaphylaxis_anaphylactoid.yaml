summary: >
  Systemic hypersensitivity response presenting with cardiovascular collapse,
  airway compromise, or cutaneous signs that demands immediate epinephrine and trigger mitigation.

signals:
  - "Sudden hypotension with tachycardia after exposure to a potential allergen"
  - "Bronchospasm, wheeze, or difficulty ventilating"
  - "Urticaria, flushing, or facial edema during anesthesia"

red_flags:
  - "Rapid progression to cardiovascular collapse or airway obstruction"
  - "Biphasic reactions occurring after initial stabilization"

primary_differential:
  - "Anaphylaxis"
  - "Anaphylactoid reaction"
  - "Severe bronchospasm"
  - "Pulmonary embolism"

first_checks:
  - "Stop suspected trigger and call for help"
  - "Administer epinephrine per protocol and provide 100% oxygen"
  - "Secure airway and initiate volume resuscitation"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could another cause explain hypotension, or is a second diagnosis present?"
  - "Have serum tryptase samples been obtained for confirmation?"
  - "Is there a need for prolonged observation for biphasic reaction?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid beta-blockers during active anaphylaxis unless directed by specialist"
  - "Exercise caution with colloids that may exacerbate reactions"
