summary: >
  Sudden loss of effective cardiac output requiring immediate initiation of
  ACLS with simultaneous search for reversible causes tailored to the operative setting.

signals:
  - "Loss of arterial waveform or pulse oximetry signal"
  - "ECG showing asystole, pulseless VT/VF, or organized rhythm without pulse"
  - "Capnography drop indicating loss of perfusion"

red_flags:
  - "Failure to achieve return of spontaneous circulation after ACLS cycles"
  - "Unidentified reversible causes among the Hs and Ts"

primary_differential:
  - "Hypovolemia or hemorrhage"
  - "Hypoxia"
  - "Hydrogen ion (acidosis)"
  - "Electrolyte shift (hypo/hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia)"
  - "Hypothermia"
  - "Tension pneumothorax"
  - "Cardiac tamponade"
  - "Thrombosis or massive embolism"

first_checks:
  - "Call for help, start chest compressions, and follow ACLS algorithm"
  - "Ensure 100% oxygen delivery and confirm advanced airway placement"
  - "Assign team roles and document timing of interventions"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Have reversible Hs and Ts been systematically addressed?"
  - "Would ultrasound or TEE help identify the underlying cause?"
  - "Is ECMO or specialized support indicated if arrest persists?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Pause compressions only for rhythm checks or life-saving interventions"
  - "Coordinate with surgical team regarding ongoing operative considerations"
