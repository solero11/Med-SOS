summary: >
  Patient consciousness or recall during anesthesia, typically identified by
  movement, autonomic signs, or patient report, necessitating rapid assessment of anesthetic delivery.

signals:
  - "Unexpected movement or hemodynamic response despite neuromuscular blockade"
  - "High BIS or processed EEG readings inconsistent with anesthetic depth"
  - "Patient report of awareness postoperatively"

red_flags:
  - "Evidence of inadequate anesthetic delivery due to infusion or vaporizer failure"
  - "Psychological distress or post-traumatic response risk"

primary_differential:
  - "Inadequate anesthetic dosing"
  - "Equipment malfunction"
  - "Pharmacologic resistance or drug interactions"
  - "Light anesthesia for hemodynamic management"

first_checks:
  - "Verify anesthetic delivery systems and concentrations"
  - "Increase anesthetic depth while maintaining hemodynamic stability"
  - "Provide amnestic agents if awareness suspected"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could analgesia or sedation adjuncts be optimized to reduce recall?"
  - "Has the event been documented and communicated to the patient compassionately?"
  - "Do we need multidisciplinary follow-up for psychological support?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid dismissing patient concern without thorough evaluation"
  - "Use caution with benzodiazepines in patients at risk for delirium"
