summary: >
  Emergent loss of both intubation and oxygenation capability requiring
  immediate rescue to preserve oxygen delivery and prevent cardiac arrest.

signals:
  - "Repeated unsuccessful intubation attempts with worsening oxygen saturation"
  - "Inability to maintain ventilation or oxygenation despite adjuncts"
  - "Rapidly deteriorating hemodynamics or loss of capnography waveform"

red_flags:
  - "Stridor or no air movement despite airway adjuncts"
  - "Bradycardia or hypotension signalling imminent arrest"

primary_differential:
  - "Severe airway obstruction"
  - "Anatomic anomaly"
  - "Laryngospasm"
  - "Equipment malfunction"

first_checks:
  - "Call for help and announce failed airway protocol"
  - "Initiate 100% oxygen and optimize positioning"
  - "Assess for possible surgical airway landmarks"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Have you limited intubation attempts to avoid airway trauma?"
  - "Is a surgical airway or ECMO team immediately available?"
  - "Could supraglottic ventilation temporarily restore oxygenation?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid repeated attempts that worsen edema or bleeding"
  - "Ensure cricoid pressure is released if impairing ventilation"
