summary: >
  Clinically significant bradycardia or pulseless electrical activity causing
  hypotension or collapse, necessitating immediate evaluation and resuscitation.

signals:
  - "Heart rate <40 bpm with hypotension or poor perfusion"
  - "Loss of pulse despite organized electrical activity"
  - "Asystolic tracing on ECG or monitor artifact mimicking bradycardia"

red_flags:
  - "Rapid progression to cardiac arrest"
  - "Underlying reversible cause such as hyperkalemia or vagal stimulus"

primary_differential:
  - "Excess anesthetic or vagal stimulation"
  - "Hypoxemia or ischemia"
  - "Electrolyte imbalance"
  - "Conduction system disease"

first_checks:
  - "Assess airway, breathing, circulation, and confirm pulse"
  - "Call for help, initiate ACLS protocol as indicated"
  - "Evaluate recent medications, surgical manipulations, and labs"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could surgical traction or vagal reflex be driving the bradycardia?"
  - "Is there a reversible Hs and Ts cause that must be addressed now?"
  - "Would transcutaneous or transvenous pacing stabilize the patient?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid atropine in transplanted hearts where it may be ineffective"
  - "Careful with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers when conduction impaired"
