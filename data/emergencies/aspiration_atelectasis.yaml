summary: >
  Inhalation of gastric contents or collapse of alveolar units leading to
  impaired oxygenation, inflammatory response, and increased risk of pneumonia.

signals:
  - "Witnessed regurgitation or particulate matter in the airway"
  - "Sudden hypoxemia with coarse breath sounds"
  - "Radiographic or ultrasound evidence of dependent opacities"

red_flags:
  - "Hemodynamic instability suggesting simultaneous airway obstruction"
  - "Progressive infiltrates despite supportive care"

  - "Pulmonary edema"
  - "Pneumonitis"
  - "Atelectasis from mucus plugging"

first_checks:
  - "Position head down with suction to clear oropharynx"
  - "Secure airway and provide 100% oxygen"
  - "Evaluate need for bronchoscopy or lavage per protocol"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could prophylactic antibiotics or steroids be indicated per guidelines?"
  - "Would lung recruitment maneuvers improve atelectasis without injury?"
  - "Is gastric drainage adequate to prevent recurrent aspiration?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid routine instillation of neutralizing agents into the airway"
  - "Apply recruitment carefully to prevent barotrauma in injured lungs"
