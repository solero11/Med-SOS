summary: >
  Accumulation of intrapleural air causing lung collapse and cardiovascular
  compromise, often signalled by sudden hypoxemia, high airway pressures, and
  hemodynamic change.

signals:
  - "Rising peak inspiratory pressures with declining tidal volume"
  - "Absent or diminished breath sounds on one side"
  - "Hypoxemia with increasing airway resistance or hypotension"

red_flags:
  - "Rapid cardiovascular collapse with jugular venous distention"
  - "Tracheal deviation or severe hypercarbia"

primary_differential:
  - "Bronchospasm"
  - "Mucus plug or endobronchial intubation"
  - "Hemothorax"
  - "Air embolism"

first_checks:
  - "Switch to manual ventilation and assess compliance"
  - "Confirm tube depth and auscultate both lungs"
  - "Notify surgical team and prepare for decompression"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could equipment or circuit failure explain the pressure changes?"
  - "Is needle decompression indicated before imaging?"
  - "Would ultrasound or transesophageal echocardiography clarify the diagnosis?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid high ventilation pressures that worsen barotrauma"
  - "Ensure decompression site avoids vascular grafts or surgical fields"
