summary: >
  Adverse response to blood product administration ranging from mild febrile
  reactions to life-threatening hemolysis or TRALI, requiring prompt identification and management.

signals:
  - "Fever, chills, or hypotension during transfusion"
  - "Hemoglobinuria, flank pain, or unexpected bleeding"
  - "Respiratory distress or hypoxemia shortly after transfusion"

red_flags:
  - "Evidence of acute hemolysis with renal compromise"
  - "TRALI with severe hypoxemia and pulmonary edema"

primary_differential:
  - "Acute hemolytic reaction"
  - "Febrile non-hemolytic reaction"
  - "Anaphylactic reaction"
  - "Transfusion-related acute lung injury"
  - "Transfusion-associated circulatory overload"

first_checks:
  - "Stop transfusion and maintain IV access"
  - "Verify patient and blood unit identification"
  - "Send blood and patient samples per transfusion protocol"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could this be TACO requiring diuretics and ventilation adjustment?"
  - "Have laboratory markers confirmed hemolysis or alternative diagnosis?"
  - "Is specialist consultation needed before resuming transfusion?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid restarting implicated unit without blood bank clearance"
  - "Monitor renal function and coagulation closely after severe reactions"
