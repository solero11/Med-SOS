summary: >
  Failure to regain expected consciousness postoperatively due to residual
  anesthetics, metabolic abnormalities, or neurologic injury requiring systematic evaluation.

signals:
  - "Persistent unresponsiveness beyond anticipated recovery time"
  - "Hypoventilation or airway obstruction during emergence"
  - "Abnormal pupils or neurologic findings"

red_flags:
  - "Hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, or hypoxia detected"
  - "Signs of stroke or intracranial event"

primary_differential:
  - "Residual anesthetics or neuromuscular blockade"
  - "Metabolic derangements"
  - "Neurologic injury or stroke"
  - "Hypothermia"

first_checks:
  - "Review anesthetic record for last doses and infusions"
  - "Assess neuromuscular function and consider reversal agents"
  - "Obtain blood glucose, blood gas, and electrolytes"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could concurrent medications or organ dysfunction prolong emergence?"
  - "Is imaging indicated to rule out neurologic causes?"
  - "Should ICU monitoring be initiated while diagnosis clarified?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid premature discharge from PACU without identifying cause"
  - "Use sedative reversals cautiously to prevent agitation or hypertension"
