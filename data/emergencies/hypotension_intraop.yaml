summary: >
  Mean arterial pressure below target thresholds during anesthesia that
  threatens organ perfusion and demands rapid assessment of reversible causes.

signals:
  - "Persistent MAP below institutional threshold"
  - "Accompanying tachycardia, bradycardia, or change in ETCO2"
  - "Unexpected blood loss or anesthetic depth adjustments"

red_flags:
  - "Signs of end-organ dysfunction such as ischemic ECG changes"
  - "Refractory hypotension despite fluids and vasopressors"

primary_differential:
  - "Hypovolemia or hemorrhage"
  - "Vasodilation from anesthetics or sepsis"
  - "Cardiac dysfunction (ischemia, tamponade, embolism)"
  - "Anaphylaxis"

first_checks:
  - "Verify blood pressure measurement accuracy"
  - "Assess surgical field and suction for hidden bleeding"
  - "Review recent medications and anesthetic depth"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could airway or ventilation issues be driving hypotension?"
  - "Is there a reversible medication effect that can be minimized?"
  - "Would invasive monitoring clarify the hemodynamic state?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid excessive vasopressor dosing before correcting volume status"
  - "Reassess patient positioning for vena caval compression"
