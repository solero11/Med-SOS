summary: >
  Loss or contamination of delivered oxygen due to pipeline disruption or
  cylinder depletion, requiring immediate switch to verified backup supply.

signals:
  - "Oxygen analyzer alarms or reads low oxygen concentration"
  - "Pipeline low-pressure alarm or failure of wall outlets"
  - "Hypoxemia occurring despite normal airway mechanics"

red_flags:
  - "Multiple rooms reporting oxygen issues simultaneously"
  - "Evidence of cross-connection or contamination of pipeline gas"

primary_differential:
  - "Pipeline failure"
  - "Cylinder empty or closed"
  - "Analyzer malfunction"
  - "Ventilator malfunction"

first_checks:
  - "Open backup oxygen cylinder and disconnect pipeline source"
  - "Switch to manual ventilation with self-inflating bag if needed"
  - "Confirm analyzer calibration using known oxygen source"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Has engineering or facilities been notified to confirm central supply status?"
  - "Could analyzer failure be misguiding the response?"
  - "Are other anesthetizing locations experiencing similar alarms?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid reconnecting to pipeline until verified safe"
  - "Check oxygen flush valves cautiously to conserve limited supply"
