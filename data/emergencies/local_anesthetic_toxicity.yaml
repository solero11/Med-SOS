summary: >
  Systemic absorption or intravascular injection of local anesthetic leading to
  neurologic and cardiovascular toxicity requiring prompt lipid therapy and supportive care.

signals:
  - "Perioral numbness, tinnitus, or metallic taste after injection"
  - "Seizure activity or altered mental status"
  - "Wide complex arrhythmias, hypotension, or cardiac arrest"

red_flags:
  - "Cardiovascular collapse refractory to standard ACLS"
  - "High dose bupivacaine or ropivacaine implicated"

primary_differential:
  - "Local anesthetic systemic toxicity"
  - "Intravascular injection of epinephrine-containing solution"
  - "Hypoxia or hypoglycemia"
  - "Seizure disorder"

first_checks:
  - "Stop local anesthetic administration and call for help"
  - "Secure airway and provide 100% oxygen"
  - "Initiate lipid emulsion therapy per protocol"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Is cardiopulmonary bypass or ECMO available if lipid rescue fails?"
  - "Have cumulative doses been calculated including previous injections?"
  - "Could reduced dosing be used in future due to patient weight or comorbidities?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid vasopressin, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers during LAST arrest"
  - "Limit epinephrine dosing to avoid exacerbating arrhythmias"
