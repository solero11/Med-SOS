summary: >
  Acute decrease in oxygen saturation or arterial oxygenation requiring rapid
  assessment of the airway, lungs, circuit, and patient physiology.

signals:
  - "SpO2 below target despite high inspired oxygen"
  - "Falling PaO2 or arterial desaturation on blood gas"
  - "Capnography, airway pressure, or breath sounds changing unexpectedly"

red_flags:
  - "Hemodynamic compromise accompanying hypoxemia"
  - "Evidence of airway obstruction or unilateral breath sounds"

primary_differential:
  - "Airway obstruction or displacement"
  - "Ventilation-perfusion mismatch"
  - "Pneumothorax"
  - "Aspiration or atelectasis"
  - "Pulmonary embolism or air embolism"

first_checks:
  - "Confirm probe placement and calibration for SpO2"
  - "Increase FiO2 to 100% and assess airway patency"
  - "Auscultate lungs, check circuit pressures, and evaluate ventilator"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could equipment malfunction explain the desaturation?"
  - "Would manual ventilation clarify compliance and breath sounds?"
  - "Is there a reversible cause such as mucus plug, pneumothorax, or embolism?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid delaying definitive airway assessment while troubleshooting devices"
  - "Take care with high airway pressures that risk barotrauma"
