summary: >
  Acute narrowing of bronchial smooth muscle leading to high airway pressures,
  wheeze, and hypoxemia that requires prompt bronchodilation and cause review.

signals:
  - "Expiratory wheeze or silent chest with resistance to ventilation"
  - "Elevated peak inspiratory pressure and prolonged expiration"
  - "Falling oxygen saturation or rising ETCO2"

red_flags:
  - "Hemodynamic instability suggesting air-trapping or tension physiology"
  - "Concurrent rash or hypotension pointing toward anaphylaxis"

primary_differential:
  - "Reactive airway disease"
  - "Anaphylaxis"
  - "Aspiration"
  - "Mechanical obstruction or kinked tube"

first_checks:
  - "Switch to manual ventilation to gauge compliance"
  - "Ensure 100% oxygen and deepen anesthetic as needed"
  - "Administer bronchodilator therapy per protocol"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Could anaphylaxis or aspiration be triggering the bronchospasm?"
  - "Is there a mechanical obstruction such as secretions or kinking?"
  - "Would adjusting ventilator settings reduce air trapping?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid excessive manual ventilation pressures that risk barotrauma"
  - "Consider ketamine cautiously if hemodynamics are unstable"
