summary: >
  Mechanical obstruction of cardiac filling or outflow from pericardial fluid
  accumulation or intracardiac thrombus, often presenting with hypotension and
  echocardiographic abnormalities.

signals:
  - "Hypotension with equalization of diastolic pressures"
  - "TEE showing chamber collapse or intracardiac clot"
  - "Jugular venous distention with muffled heart sounds"

red_flags:
  - "Rapid decompensation requiring emergent surgical intervention"
  - "Coexistent coagulopathy complicating drainage or thrombectomy"

primary_differential:
  - "Pericardial tamponade"
  - "Intracardiac thrombosis"
  - "Pulmonary embolism"
  - "Tension pneumothorax"

first_checks:
  - "Initiate hemodynamic support and optimize preload"
  - "Consult surgical or cardiology teams for drainage or thrombectomy"
  - "Confirm diagnosis with echocardiography"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Is the tamponade physiology due to bleeding requiring immediate control?"
  - "Would anticoagulation or thrombolysis worsen surgical bleeding risk?"
  - "Can percutaneous drainage stabilize the patient before definitive repair?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Avoid aggressive positive pressure ventilation that may reduce venous return"
  - "Balance anticoagulation against bleeding risk in the operative field"
