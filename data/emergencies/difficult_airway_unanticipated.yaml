summary: >
  Unforeseen challenges with mask ventilation or tracheal intubation that
  threaten oxygenation and require structured escalation and backup plans.

signals:
  - "Repeated grade 3–4 views despite optimal positioning"
  - "Difficult mask ventilation with rising airway pressures"
  - "Desaturation despite airway adjuncts"

red_flags:
  - "Rapidly dropping oxygen saturation below 90%"
  - "Airway bleeding, edema, or trauma developing during attempts"

primary_differential:
  - "Anatomical variation"
  - "Inadequate positioning or muscle relaxation"
  - "Equipment failure or inappropriate device size"
  - "Unrecognized airway pathology"

first_checks:
  - "Pause and optimize position, external laryngeal manipulation, and blades"
  - "Call for assistance and prepare advanced airway devices"
  - "Consider awakening patient if oxygenation remains adequate"

cognitive_prompts:
  - "Would a supraglottic airway provide safe oxygenation while regrouping?"
  - "Should you switch operators or techniques before additional trauma occurs?"
  - "Have you prepared for a surgical airway if attempts continue to fail?"

contraindications_notes:
  - "Limit attempts to avoid airway swelling and bleeding"
  - "Reassess neuromuscular blockade before another attempt"
