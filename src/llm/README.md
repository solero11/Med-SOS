# LLM Module


Handles all communication with the local LLM (e.g., LM Studio Medicine 13B).
- API client
- Prompt construction
- System prompt enforcement (question-based output)
- **Tested via the chaos harness and monitored for parse compliance/telemetry.**

Each submodule should have a README and tests.
